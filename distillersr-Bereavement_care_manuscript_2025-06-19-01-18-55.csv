although the expression of grief appears to be similar in Western and Chinese cultures, there are sociocultural differences in the grieving process; Chen and colleagues (2017) found that dual process model, which was developed in Western countries, captured the overall coping mechanisms of Chinese bereaved mothers effectively; yet at a micro level, cultural factors should be taken into account when exploring the nuanced meanings embedded in the emotional and behavioral coping process; the content of restoration-oriented coping in America that dealt with financial and legal issues as well as social participation were not relevant to Hong Kong Chinese situation as Chinese people rarely discuss their financial situation with others; Chinese people tend to be concerned about their health, particularly after the death of a spouse, thus the themes of health-related topics were added; the themes of attending to life changes and household chores in the American model were kept as they were universal; moreover, rituals were usually used in the Chinese funerals or bereavement groups for expressing emotions in a structured way; a commonly used letting go ritual was included in the Chinese model; the participants released fishes into the wild, symbolizing the letting go of pain and suffering attached to the bereavement;

Prior research suggests that emotion-based interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy can reduce the incidence of depressive disorders in at-risk individuals. However, it was noteworthy that in our study better improvement occurred with Functional Therapy. Programs directed at spousally bereaved individuals, including self-help groups and function-based therapies to improve post-bereavement adaptation, have been shown to improve functional outcomes, but their effect on emotion variables has not been well substantiated. Our study suggests that function therapy may result in improvements in both emotion and function variables; thus filling that gap in the literature.
